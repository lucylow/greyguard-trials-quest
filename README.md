**Project Overview**
--------------------

**GreyGuard Trials** is a next-generation decentralized clinical trial matching platform designed to eliminate data silos and biases from patient recruitment. By leveraging AI-powered autonomous agents running on the Fetch.ai Agentverse combined with an ICP blockchain backend, it securely matches patients with clinical trials based on transparent, privacy-preserving criteria.

Our mission is to ensure **no more grey areas in clinical matching** — providing more equitable, efficient, and trustworthy clinical trial recruitment for patients, researchers, and sponsors worldwide.

**Problem Statement & Motivation**
----------------------------------

Clinical trials are crucial for advancing medical science, but recruitment problems stall innovation:

*   Nearly 80% of clinical trials miss enrollment deadlines, and up to a third fail entirely.
    
*   Existing centralized models create opaque, biased, and inefficient matchings.
    
*   Patients lose control over their sensitive health data and fear privacy breaches.
    
*   Underrepresented populations face systemic exclusion due to poor outreach and lack of access.
    

**GreyGuard Trials** addresses these critical pain points by enabling decentralized, transparent, and AI-powered clinical trial matching that puts **patients in control** and bridges healthcare equity gaps globally.

**Key Features & Solution Description**
---------------------------------------

*   **Decentralized Data Ownership:** Secure patient data pods stored on IPFS and ICP, enabling patients full control with zero-knowledge proofs to authorize sharing.
    
*   **AI-Driven Trial Matching:** NLP-powered agents analyze trial eligibility criteria and patients' medical metadata to find precise matches without revealing sensitive raw data.
    
*   **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Separate agents represent patients, sponsors, and investigators — negotiating recruitment in a real-time, trustless environment on Agentverse.
    
*   **Smart Contract Eligibility Checks:** Transparency guaranteed through ICP canisters verifying trial criteria according to predefined rules.
    
*   **Privacy & Compliance:** Built-in HIPAA and GDPR adherence, anonymization, and consent management ensure ethical data usage.
    
*   **Interoperability:** Integrates APIs from major trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, EU Clinical Trials Register, WHO ICTRP) and EMR providers.
    

**Architecture & Technology Stack**
-----------------------------------

*   **Frontend:** ReactJS patient and sponsor dashboard with real-time notifications and match tracking.
    
*   **Agent Layer:** Autonomous matching agents deployed on the Fetch.ai Agentverse, leveraging GPT-4o-turbo fine-tuned for medical NLP tasks.
    
*   **Backend:** Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) smart contracts managing trial eligibility and consent verification.
    
*   **Storage:** Encrypted personal data pods on IPFS for decentralized patient data storage.
    
*   **Security:** DID (decentralized identifiers) combined with zk-SNARKs for proof of consent without data exposure.
    
*   **APIs:** RESTful interfaces for clinical trial data integration and white-label partner solutions.
